    <h1>SIMPLE SOURDOUGH PIZZA</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This sourdough pizza crust is …

        Basic! Given supply constraints, I didn’t get creative with the flour mix here. <br>
        This dough is made with 100% all-purpose flour. You absolutely can use bread flour or tipo 00 flour (read more about tipo 00 flour here) if you can get your hands on either.<br>
         If you have been having a hard time finding flour, Baker’s Authority is a great option — great prices, too, even with shipping tacked on.<br>
        75% hydration. This is a classic sourdough formula: 375 g water, 500 g flour. <br>
        (Note: This calculation is not quite accurate, because I am not including the weight of the water and flour of the sourdough starter in the calculation.)<br>
        Simple! As with all of the sourdough recipes on this site, there is no autolyse or preferment or levain. I do call for some stretches and folds, which build strength in the dough. <br>
        I like to do 4 stretch and folds, but even if you can only perform one stretch and fold, your dough will benefit.

        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Stir to combine then add...</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <li><strong>500 g all-purpose flour.</strong></li><br>

        <li><strong>Stir until you have a sticky dough ball.</strong></li><br>
       
        <li><strong>Transfer to a straight-sided vessel (if possible) and let rest for 30 minutes. <br>
            Then, “stretch and fold” the dough <strong><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OipoWq9VZCI">(see video for guidance)<a/></em></strong> 4 times at 30 minute intervals.<br>
            Cover the vessel. Let it rest for 6 to 12 hours (see recipe notes for timing) or until the dough…</strong></li><br>
        
        <li><strong>… has about doubled in volume.</strong></li><br>
    
        <li><strong>Turn dough out onto a work surface. Use flour here as needed.</strong></li><br>
      
        <li><strong>Portion into 4 equal pieces, again using flour as needed.</strong></li><br>
        
        <li><strong>Ball up and transfer to quart (or other similar-sized) containers (I love these deli quart containers).<br>
             Transfer to the fridge, ideally for at least 6 hours and up to 3 days.</strong></li><br>
            
        <li><strong>An hour prior to baking, remove a round (or more) of pizza dough, <br>
            and place it on a floured work surface. If you have a Baking Steel, place it in the upper<br>
             third of your oven, and heat the oven to 550ºF. (See recipe for other options.)</strong></li><br>

        <li><strong>Delicately stretch the dough into a round, trying as best you can to preserve those air pockets.</strong></li><br>

        <li><strong>Top as you wish. This one is spread with tomato sauce and topped with fresh mozzarella, parmesan, olive oil, and sea salt.</strong></li><br>

        <li><strong>Transfer pizza, parchment paper and all to a preheated Baking Steel or stone in a 550ºF oven. Bake 5 to 6 minutes or until cooked to your liking.</strong></li><br>

        <li><strong>Slice and serve.</strong></li><br>

        <li><strong>A little fresh basil is always nice.</strong></li><br>
