    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Focaccia is our favorite yeast bread to make at home. It has a crisp outside and soft inside,<br>
        and is perfect to serve with dinner, soups, stews, or even sliced in half and used for sandwiches.<br>
        Thanks to the ingredients, it’s also naturally vegan. This garlic focaccia bread recipe is very simple to make – no fancy equipment is needed at all.</p>

    <h3>STEPS</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Infuse olive oil with garlic and fresh herbs. This simple step makes the bread unbelievably delicious.</strong></li><br>

        <li><strong>Mix yeast with warm water and honey. This wakes up the yeast so that it is ready to help the dough rise.</strong></li><br>
       
        <li><strong>Add the flour, salt, and some of the garlic herb oil to the yeast mixture, and then knead the dough 10 to 15 times (no more kneading is necessary).</strong></li><br>
        
        <li><strong>Let the dough rise until doubled in size (about 1 hour).</strong></li><br>
    
        <li><strong>Add the dough to a small sheet pan or baking dish and add dimples to the top of the dough and top with the remaining garlic herb oil.</strong></li><br>
      
        <li><strong>Let the bread rise for another 20 minutes, and then bake until golden brown.</strong></li><br>

    </ol>
