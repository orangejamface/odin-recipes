    <h1>NO-KNEAD SOURDOUGH BREAD RECIPE</h1>
    <img src="../img/bread.jpg" height="400" alt="sourdough loaf of bread"/>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>we really like sourdough bread! So it is time for a nice sourdough bread with 65% hydration.
        <br><br>
        A good sourdough bread is the base of a good meal, so it is very important to have a variety of recipes so you can choose between them.
        <br><br>
        This recipe has a low hydration, it is quite easy to handle and and you don’t need any yeast at all, but can use some if your sourdough starter is not that powerfull yet.
        <br><br>
        As a general rule you can remember: The higher the hydration, the more advanced the handling. Just start with the simpler ones and faster than you expect,<br> you will also be able to handle the more advanced recipes.</p>

                <li>Cover the dough and let it rest for a total of 2,5 hours at 20-22°C (68-71,6°F)</li>
                <li>During that time stretch & fold the dough every 30 minutes (3 times in total) and 
                    after the 3rd time let it ferment further for 1 hour until 2,5 hours in total are reached</li>
                <li>After each stretch and fold put it back to the bowl and cover it again so it doesn’t dry out</li><br>
