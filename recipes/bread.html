    <div class="testing">we really like sourdough bread! So it is time for a nice sourdough bread with 65% hydration.
        <br><br>
        A good sourdough bread is the base of a good meal, so it is very important to have a variety of recipes so you can choose between them.
        <br><br>
        This recipe has a low hydration, it is quite easy to handle and and you don’t need any yeast at all, but can use some if your sourdough starter is not that powerfull yet.
        <br><br>
        As a general rule you can remember: The higher the hydration, the more advanced the handling. Just start with the simpler ones and faster than you expect,<br> <br>you will also be able to handle the more advanced recipes.
